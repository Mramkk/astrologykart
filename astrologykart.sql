There, the Islamic Foundation\'s Lunar Witness Committee decides when Eid is. The committee will meet on the afternoon of the 29th of Ramadan to decide on Eid Day.

Then, in February, the number of days increases by one. The leap year lasts 366 days. The moon, like the earth, circles around it. According to science, if the earth stays in place and the moon continues to circle, the moon will complete one rotation of the earth in 27 days, but the earth also revolves. As a result, one rotation of the Earth and Moon is completed in 29 days and a few hours. The moon seen after one orbit is referred to as the new moon.

A difficult marriage is the result of negative planetary forces in our birth chart, which have ties to our former incarnations.

Most of the time, the primary cause of problems between spouses is a lack of mutual compatibility.

It is critical to understand that these issues may be resolved with competent astrological counsel.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Couple\'s Married Life Issues</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>1. <strong>Loss of interpersonal compatibility-</strong> When there is bhakoot dosha in the Kundli, couples struggle to comprehend each other. Both the janma nakshatra and the Rashi lords affect the mental pursuits of the inhabitants, so both must be in harmony for the couple to be compatible.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>2. <strong>Lack of Communication- </strong>In the early phases, the couple attempts to avoid arguing or addressing their issues. However, misconceptions accumulate over time, resulting in harsh relations between them. The position of Mercury and the second house will be significant here. </p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>3. <strong>Absolute dominance- </strong>A spouse may desire for his or her mate to be exactly like him or her. It is almost impossible, and couples begin to argue as a result of a lack of personal space in a relationship. Interference should be limited and should not overpower the romance of marriage.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>4. <strong>Extramarital affairs-</strong> Malefic planets with influences at the Lagna or Moon might cause any of the partners to engage in extramarital encounters. This is detrimental to the marriage.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>5. Financial aspects: </strong> A lack of financial success or monetary transparency can cause major problems in a marriage. The woman may expect her partner to provide financial stability for her, something the male partner may not do.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>6. <strong>Jealousy and pride-</strong> This occurs when both couples earn. One person may feel envious or insecure about the other person\'s better financial earnings or pay. This causes a gap between the life partners.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>7. <strong>Lacking personal intimacy-</strong> The spouses may lack sexual closeness due to overwork or exhaustion. This, in turn, leads to a troubled married life over time. By enhancing Venus, the karaka of romance and love in married life, astrology may aid to promote sexual closeness between spouses.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>8. <strong>Cultural differences</strong>- The spouses may come from different cultural backgrounds with distinct value systems. This might become the root of the spouses\' disputes and resentment.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>9. <strong>In-law interference-</strong> In certain circumstances, the female finds it difficult to adjust to her in-laws\' excessive meddling in their married connections. This eventually leads to a rift between the pair. For a native, the 4th and 10th homes are the houses of father-in-law and mother-in-law, respectively.
