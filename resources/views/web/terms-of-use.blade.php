                <p>This agreement, titled "Member Terms of Use," applies to all users ("members") who access and/or use the
                    Astrology Kart platform for online Astrologer consultation.</p>

                <h2>What exactly is Astrology Kart?</h2>
                <p>Astrology Kart gives a platform for members to find an Astrologer and get guidance and counsel from these
                    Astrologers. Astrology Kart provides a platform for one-on-one connection between users and Astrologers
                    via direct consultation (chat or phone), texts, and the ability to pay for services obtained from an
                    Astrologer.</p>
                <p>Astrology Kart's telephone function, i.e. the Talk To Astrologer service, is accessible in India and in
                    different countries.</p>

                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>Users/Members are entirely responsible for verifying an Astrologer's identification, credentials,

                    Astrology Kart, and that Astrology Kart accepts no responsibility for the behaviour of any such
                    Astrologer.</p>
                <p>All of the Astrologers are self - employed of Astrology Kart, and because they work as freelancers,

                <h2>SERVICE CHARGES AND TRANSACTIONS</h2>
                <p>All contacts between you and an Astrologer, whether online or offline, will be invoiced through the
                    Astrology Kart platform. When using Astrology Kart services, you agree to accept the payment terms
                    agreed upon with an Astrologer and to pay Astrology Kart the requisite fee for the services offered to
                    you through the Astrologers.</p>
                <p>To make your payments more convenient, you must add money to your Astrology Kart wallet, which is
                    available to all Members for free. Your money is going to be withdrawn from your wallet's particular
                    ways as incurred, either while offering services or during a session with an Astrologer. You may
                    recharge your Astrology Kart wallet by selecting one of the accessible payment options. It is your duty
                    to ensure that the account information you provided is always correct and up to date, and that you fully
                    agree to allow the use of your card and payment information. You may be need to use your email or OTP to

                    holds the right to charge the online payments associated to the Member's account, including taxes and
                    late fees, until these payments are settled in full.</p>
                <p>Time expenses are calculated on a per-minute basis using Astrology Kart's servers. A tiny proportion of a
                    minute is always rounded up to a full minute. It is important to mentioned that no payment system is
                    fault-free, and the same is applicable for the Astrology Kart payment gateway. As a result, Astrology
                    Kart will not be held liable for any such inaccuracies or glitches during payment processing. If you
                    believe a pricing error has occurred or if you seek explanations on your invoiced amount, please contact

                    following:
                </p>
