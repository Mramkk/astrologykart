            <h2>What is Astrology? - Talk to best astrologer in India</h2>
            <p>Astrology is the basic feature that mostly connects with the scientific
                transcended
                reading and helps people to provide the right direction to their future. Astrology never claims to be a
                perfect
                or accurate reading however it gives a basic rough idea of what currently a person is going through, and
                consecutively it helps in giving those solutions through their astronomy knowledge.&nbsp;It is also called
                an
                art of pseudoscience that professes to observe certain information related to human affairs or other
                sublunary
                events by gaining the knowledge of the movements and respected positions of celestial objects. Astrology is
                the
                oldest form of culture that is still now perceived as an important part of our daily lifestyle. Astrology
                never
                tries to be superstitious, however; it really tries you to learn with leading knowledge so that reason
                behind
                every certain logic is provided by an astrologer in the quickest way.</p>


            <h2>Why Astrology is required?</h2>

            <p>Every human need a basic guidance related to astrology as there are certain
                things
                that are correlated to science. Astrology states that cleanliness is very necessary for wealth consecutively
                science also claims that cleanliness is essential as dust can invite lots of diseases and harm your health.
                So,
                astrology is interrelated to science with no actual logic however science always has logic and solution to
                deal
                with the problem. Astrology has different intricacies where they have to study different cosmic objects in
                the
                celestial bodies usually about planets and stars in the solar system.</p>

            <p>There is a total of 8 planets in the solar system however in astrology the
                planets
                are counted as nine, and they are stated as NAVGRAHAS. The interesting part is that Earth is not considered
                as
                part of planets in astrology. Here you will only find Mars (Mangala), Mercury (Budha), Jupiter (Brihaspati),
                Venus (Shukra), Saturn (Shani), Rahu (north node of the moon), Ketu (south node of the moon). Sun (Surya),
                and
                Moon (Chandra).</p>

            <p>Surprising part is that you must have heard about Rahu and Ketu always have a
                negative impact in the Kundli however it is right for sometimes however this is not the full truth as it
                only
                depends on which house the both planets are present. Sometimes Ketu can be beneficial for your Kundli as it
                happens quite a few times that Ketu is present at different house of Kundli and impacts positively.</p>




            <h3>What is the reason that Astrology is still sustained as a culture or tradition?</h3>

            <p>Astrology has a wide history for several years as dated to at least the 2nd
                millennium BCE and many cultures have claimed it as an important part of life. These cultures are Hindus,
                Maya,
                or Chinese. However, in the west, the people mostly value the horoscope system to explain the aspects of
                life by
                the human personality, and predict the future through positions of different celestial bodies around the
                universe like the sun, moon, or other planets by their time zone or birth time.</p>

            <p>There was printing in the 16th century (1551 printing of Julius Firmicus&#39;)
                where
                he shares the astrological and astronomical work of the 4th century in which he basically discusses the
                Greeks,
                Egyptians, Arabs, Romans, and Chaldeans. In that volume of scripts, many discuss the astrological prowess of
                some people from Chaldea, a small country in Mesopotamia that existed in the mid-6th to 9th or 10th
                centuries
                BCE.</p>

            <p>This totally proves that there was a time that people use to follow the way of
                astrology where they used to read or understand the celestial bodies by looking onto their birth chart which
                comprises the nine planets, or you can say &ldquo;Navgrahas&rdquo;.</p>

                Astrology is an old method of predicting upcoming events. It is the science that predicts life outcomes by
                calculating planetary motions, Nakshatras, Dashas, Yoga, and other astrological characteristics. It has been
                regarded as the most reliable and precise method of predicting the future since Vedic times. Ancient sages
                employed horoscopes and astrological computations to predict marriage, terrible and happy moments,
                forthcoming
                chances and difficulties, sicknesses, and other events. Even today, certain competent and experienced
                astrologers can assist you in determining your past, present, and future circumstances by constructing your
                horoscope and evaluating the connected astrological features.
